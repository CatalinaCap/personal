      <h1>Veli's Art</h1>
      <p>
        My name is Veli, and I have lived in East Dulwich on and off for sixty
        years. Drawing has been a passion of mine since I was young; it was the
        only subject at school that I truly excelled in. Unfortunately, my
        parents, who emigrated from Cyprus, didn’t see it as a viable career
        path. Consequently, I left school and put my artistic pursuits on hold
        for many years.
      </p>

      <p>
        Throughout my life, I have struggled with depression. In my mid-forties,
        I experienced a complete mental breakdown and was hospitalized at
        Maudsley for two and a half months. During my stay, I found solace in
        the arts and crafts room, where my love for art began to heal my mind.
      </p>

      <p>
        After being discharged, I enrolled in a pre-foundation course, which led
        to a place at the Metropolitan University for Art in Whitechapel. There,
        I completed a year-long foundation course covering drawing, painting,
        screen printing, and photography, earning a BTEC. Although I was offered
        a degree place, financial constraints and a lack of self-belief
        prevented me from continuing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now, twenty years later, I am proud to share that some of my artwork is
        on display at Café G. The work on display is intricate and detailed,
        featuring shapes and layers influenced by Asia and the Ottoman lands. I
        love working through the night when it’s still and quiet, often seeing
        the morning light. My art creates worlds where dreams can come true,
        with spheres and bubbles floating towards the sky symbolizing freedom
        and hope.
